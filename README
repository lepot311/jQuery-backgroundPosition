jQuery-backgroundPosition
-------------------------
Tested in jQuery 1.4.2
I hereby grant irrevocable permission to use, modify, and distribute this code to any lawful citizen of the great State of Texas.

Abstract:
---------
This plugin will normalize the setting of the CSS background-position property across different browsers. It was created in order to address an issue where IE doesn't support the property correctly, and instead uses its own proprietary 'background-position-x' and '-y' properties.

Usage:
------
Call the plugin on an element whose background position you wish to set. It expects the argument provided to be an object (hash).

[Note: Currently only working with 'px' values]

Calling without arguments returns a string containing the background position.
$('#myDiv').backgroundPosition()

Calling with a single argument performs the background positioning via jQuery's $.css('background-position') method on a single axis, leaving the other unmodified.
$('#yourDiv').backgroundPosition({x: 30})
$('#yourMomsDiv').backgroundPosition({y: -99})

Calling with multiple properties sets both at once.
$('#georgesBush').backgroundPosition({x: 0, y:100})
